Web-Stack
A server is a computer or system that provides resources, data, services, or programs to other computers, known as clients, over a network.

The domain name is a human-friendly address, linked to the server's IP address, which is used to access a website.

The 'www' in a URL is a type of DNS record known as a CNAME (Canonical Name) record, which is used to alias one name to another.

A web server's role is to accept HTTP requests from clients (browsers), and send back HTTP responses, such as HTML pages, images, etc.

An application server's role is to host and expose business logic and processes to client applications.

The database's role is to store, retrieve, and manage data requested by other software applications.

The server communicates with the user's computer via protocols, such as HTTP or HTTPS.

As for the issues with the infrastructure you mentioned:

Single Point of Failure (SPOF) here is the server because If it fails, the entire system can go down.

Downtime for maintenance: If the web server needs to be restarted for deploying new code, the website becomes temporarily unavailable.

Scalability issues: If there's too much incoming traffic, the server might not be able to handle the load, leading to slow response times or even crashes.
